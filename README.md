Run-List-Parser
===============

   
    Description:
    A user can input the hexadecimal values of a run list from
    the $DATA attribute of a $MFT File record and the program
    will output information about the run list including the cluster
    locations of the file fragments throughout the volume.

    The intended use of the program is to assist in the recovery of
    lost or deleted files during computer forensic analysis.
